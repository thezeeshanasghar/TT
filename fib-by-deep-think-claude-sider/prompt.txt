Create an automated trading bot designed for scalping that utilizes Fibonacci retracement and Support & Resistance (SNR) strategies. The bot should be capable of executing trades based on predefined criteria using these strategies, optimizing for efficiency and minimal response time. 

### Additional details:
1. **Fibonacci Retracement**: Understand how to calculate Fibonacci levels and incorporate them into the bot's trading logic. Define the criteria for entering and exiting trades based on these levels.
2. **Support and Resistance**: Identify recent high and low prices to determine key support and resistance levels. The bot should incorporate these levels to inform its trading decisions.
3. **Scalping Strategy**: The bot should focus on making small profits on quick trades while managing risks effectively. Include parameters for trade size, stop loss, and take profit.
4. **Configuration Options**: Allow users to customize parameters, including time frames, indicators, and strategies employed.

### Steps:
- Analyze market data to identify Fibonacci levels for the chosen forex assets.
- Monitor price action to determine support and resistance levels.
- Execute trades based on signals generated by the intersecting Fibonacci levels and SNR points. 

### Output Format:
- A comprehensive code script written in Python using Metatrader 5 or the chosen programming language.
- Include comments explaining the functionality of key sections of the code for clarity.

### Example:
- **Input**: Trading pair: EUR/USD, Time Frame: 1-minute chart
- **Output**: A fully-functioning Python script that includes the trading logic, configuration options, and backtesting capabilities.

### Notes:
- Ensure the bot adheres to any relevant trading regulations.
- Monitor and optimize performance regularly; consider different market conditions that could affect scalping strategies.
