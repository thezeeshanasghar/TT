00:00:10.639 essential parts of smart money Concepts

00:00:17.600 liquidity concepts with a single
00:00:19.400 indicator that is completely free and
00:00:21.720 open source today we'll break down
00:00:24.359 exactly how this gem works and at the
00:00:26.480 end of the video show you the best
00:00:28.279 features and setups to use in real
00:00:30.000 markets to easily outsmart dumb money oh
00:00:33.000 you almost had it you got to be quicker
00:00:35.239 than that at the foundation of this
00:00:36.680 indicator is Market structure structure
00:00:39.160 is used as an easy way to detect Trend
00:00:41.399 changes and validate existing ones using
00:00:43.680 price action in an uptrend the market
00:00:45.680 makes higher highs and higher lows but
00:00:47.840 if a higher low point is broken a red CH
00:00:50.480 label which stands for change of
00:00:51.920 character is plotted and this tells us
00:00:53.680 the market Direction has changed however
00:00:55.960 if instead of breaking that higher low
00:00:57.640 point the previous higher high point is
00:00:59.640 broken toen it signifies that the market
00:01:01.920 trend is continuing and a BOS label
00:01:04.360 which stands for break of structure will
00:01:06.000 be plotted these labels are called
00:01:07.960 realtime internal structures however
00:01:11.119 these internal structures often exist
00:01:13.119 within larger ones if you zoom out
00:01:15.159 you'll see larger solid lines
00:01:16.840 representing swing structures these
00:01:19.119 swing structures work the same as
00:01:20.840 internal ones but can be used to
00:01:22.640 determine how significant a directional
00:01:24.520 change may be for example you can have
00:01:27.159 an internal bearish change of character
00:01:29.119 created but but if it's within a larger
00:01:31.400 bullish swing structure it could be a
00:01:33.759 sign that the trend change might not be
00:01:35.399 as significant and you may want to be
00:01:37.399 cautious if holding trades for a long
00:01:39.240 time in that direction in addition to
00:01:41.360 structure the indicator can also detect
00:01:43.399 equal highs and lows and major price
00:01:45.360 points such as daily weekly and monthly
00:01:47.479 levels Traders will often use these
00:01:49.360 levels together to locate areas of
00:01:51.079 resting liquidity in this example an
00:01:53.880 equal low is detected suggesting that
00:01:56.159 the price is struggling to go lower now
00:01:58.600 we can see that the price then swept
00:02:00.640 that daily low which might have been a
00:02:02.479 pull on liquidity to go higher it's Then
00:02:04.560 followed by a change of character at
00:02:06.320 which point could then be traded into
00:02:08.239 this order block above which also brings
00:02:10.520 us to the next major part of this
00:02:12.000 indicator order blocks and fair value
00:02:14.400 gaps order blocks are areas in the
00:02:16.440 market where there is significant buying
00:02:18.200 and selling activity and when the price
00:02:20.360 returns to these levels there's often a
00:02:22.400 strong reaction the indicator will show
00:02:24.319 you bullish order blocks in blue and
00:02:26.440 bearish in red and you can use these
00:02:28.640 areas to take profit or exit your trades
00:02:31.200 just like with Market structure you can
00:02:33.120 detect more significant blocks by
00:02:34.800 enabling swing order blocks a Trader may
00:02:37.200 choose to use internal order blocks to
00:02:39.080 enter trades and more significant swing
00:02:41.159 order blocks as areas to exit fair value
00:02:43.920 gaps can also be enabled and these are
00:02:45.879 imbalances within the price that needs
00:02:47.480 to be filled price will gravitate
00:02:49.319 towards them and they're often used to
00:02:51.000 find more precise areas within a
00:02:52.760 retracement to enter a trade the
00:02:54.640 indicator also includes a premium and
00:02:56.640 discount feature which can help detect
00:02:58.560 regions of supply and demand in the
00:03:00.239 market so if you're thinking about
00:03:02.239 taking a Buy trade but the price is
00:03:04.200 above the equilibrium you may want to
00:03:06.200 wait for a pullback to the discount Zone
00:03:08.040 before entering saving you from getting
00:03:09.760 stopped out in the retracement these are
00:03:11.760 the major features within this indicator
00:03:13.720 and many of these features can be
00:03:15.000 adjusted so Traders can find just the
00:03:16.920 right fit for their trading style since
00:03:19.000 the release of this indicator we've seen
00:03:21.200 tons of videos and users attempting to
00:03:23.159 use it by blindly taking trades at
00:03:25.159 change of characters or break of
00:03:26.879 structure points if you blindly execute
00:03:29.400 at these levels you will inevitably fail
00:03:31.680 as a Trader Traders are supposed to use
00:03:33.799 this tool alongside their analysis and
00:03:35.680 other complimentary indicators before
00:03:37.439 executing any trade so with that said
00:03:39.920 let's explore some of our favorite trade
00:03:41.720 setups using this indicator in this
00:03:43.720 example notice how the price is
00:03:45.400 currently bearish we know this from
00:03:47.159 seeing a bearish change of character and
00:03:48.879 a bearish break of structure label
00:03:51.000 however if we zoom out we also see that
00:03:53.239 the swing structure is bullish this
00:03:55.159 could indicate that the current internal
00:03:56.720 structure change may be a retracement of
00:03:58.680 a much larger move but if it is a
00:04:00.799 retracement when and where is it likely
00:04:03.400 to reverse and continue bullish let's
00:04:05.760 perform some volume analysis on this
00:04:07.560 entire structure to determine that now
00:04:10.360 any volume profile tool will work but
00:04:12.560 this volume tool not only shows where
00:04:14.200 the most volume is but also whether
00:04:16.040 Traders have more bullish or bearish
00:04:17.680 sentiment within that region this
00:04:19.358 indicator is the money flow profile and
00:04:21.238 it's completely free now we see that
00:04:23.360 majority of trading happened within this
00:04:25.240 price level and also notice how there is
00:04:27.280 significantly more bullish sentiment
00:04:29.039 within that price region now as price
00:04:31.080 trades into this level we don't just
00:04:32.800 execute we wait to see its reaction to
00:04:35.160 that level and now that we're seeing
00:04:36.639 larger bullish candles rejecting this
00:04:38.800 level and also notice that price has
00:04:40.639 swept the previous week's low we now
00:04:42.680 have quite a number of reasons to expect
00:04:44.440 a bullish move from this region in this
00:04:46.759 other example notice how the structure
00:04:48.759 is bearish and the price has retraced
00:04:50.520 into the swing order block now if we
00:04:52.880 enable premium and discount zones we can
00:04:55.160 see the price is above the equilibrium
00:04:57.280 which is where you want it to be for
00:04:58.520 sell trades we also see that there was a
00:05:00.600 bearish equal High plotted which is the
00:05:02.720 first sign of a possible reversal if we
00:05:04.840 now enable fair value gaps we can set a
00:05:07.080 limit order at that fair value Gap since
00:05:09.039 the structure is still bearish to get an
00:05:10.840 amazing sell trade the smart money

00:05:14.639 available for free on five different
00:05:16.720 platforms if using it on trading view a
00:05:19.120 common issue with this indicator is that
00:05:20.720 when candle coloring is enabled it only
00:05:22.840 changes the colors if the indicator is
00:05:25.240 selected an easy way to solve this issue
00:05:27.319 is to move the indicator above the
